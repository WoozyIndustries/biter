# To do list

1. Get a barebones naive method whipped up for polling the system clipboard for changes.
2. Figure out Iroh stuff for writing shit to a shared document and listening for changes and whatnot.
3. Get the code working between regular old computers first.
4. Get it working on iOS.
5. Get it workgin on Android.
6. Improve the clipboard monitoring mechanism to not be a polling design (this will require platform specific stuff to work and all that).
