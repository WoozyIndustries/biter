# To do list

- [x] Get a barebones naive method whipped up for polling the system clipboard for changes.
- [x] Figure out Iroh stuff for writing shit to a shared document and listening for changes and whatnot.
- [x] Get the code working between regular old computers first.
- [ ] Get it working on iOS.
- [ ] Get it workgin on Android.
- [ ] Improve the clipboard monitoring mechanism to not be a polling design (this will require platform specific stuff to work and all that).
